# Get a User ID, password, and port number  
All attendees will be assigned a user profile (i.e. `USER501`).  
Each user profile will have an assigned port number, between 10501 and 10526.  
The last 3 digits of the user profile will correspond with the last 3 digits of the port (so the port for USER501 is 10501).
